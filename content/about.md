I'm just another curious person interested on projects based for *nix environments, so I don't consider myself as an expert, but for now I'm enjoying taking a look on all that seems interesting for me.

I consider myself as an eternal leaner, mainly interested on roles and projects related to IT solutions based on *nix environments, automation, cloud, HPC and security, if possible with an open-source flavour.

My years of professional career influenced me to develop some skills:

- Efficient adaptation when facing cutting-edge technologies, pioneer work methiodologies and more demanding responsabilities.
- Resourceful skills driven by my aim of broadening my knoledge.
- Communication skills when interacting and collaborating with colleagues and senior-management.
- Excellent performance du to efficient attention to the detail, and problem solving skills.


Nothing at all, but I'm very interested on virtualization resources and forms to automate the process to deploy and maintain IT infrastructure.

In this section there is a list with diferent technologies where sometimes I putted my hands dirty playing with it.
