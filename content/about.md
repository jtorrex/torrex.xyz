I developed different roles as systems administrator with years of experience in HPC (High Performance Computing) at research and innovative environments. I am proficient in Linux systems and services, virtualization, containers, cloud and infrastructure solutions. Captivated by the idea of the Devops philosophy, I would like to take on roles such as a DevOps engineer or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) in projects focused on cloud, performance, automation and platform engineering.I developed different roles as systems administrator with years of experience in HPC (High Performance Computing) at research and innovative environments.
